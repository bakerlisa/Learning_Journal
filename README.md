# My Learning Journal

The goal is to not do this :) but I am human!!

My journal is based on the Rubbery Ducky Concept: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huOPVqztPdc

People always say if you teach it it helps to understand it better...somthing along those lines. So I'm going to try and make a teaching resource for the things I'm learning

PS this is completely a trial! And I'm figuring out how to present data and learning as I go along!! Bear with me and your input is always welcome!
