How I'll base my journal!

People always say if you teach it it helps to understand it better...somthing along those lines. So I'm going to try and make a teaching resource for the things I'm learning

PS this is completely a trial! And I'm figuring out how to present data and learning as I go along!! Bear with me and your input is always welcome!
