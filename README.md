# My Learning Journal

...hmmm not set on that name, but that'll have to do for now!

People always say if you teach it it helps to understand it better...somthing along those lines. So I'm going to try and make a teaching resource for the things I'm learning

PS this is completely a trial! And I'm figuring out how to present data and learning as I go along!! Bear with me and your input is always welcome!
