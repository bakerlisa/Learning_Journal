# Interview Prep

Today I spent 2-3 hours preping for an interview. I went through every element on the job description making notes on why/how I was a good canidate. On the topics I didn't know, or didn't have experience I researched each and every item. I made notes on if I knew something similar, questions, and how it could be used in the comapny

I also spent time looking up interview questions. What I found was you can ask good questions, but always think about why you are aksing the question. What's in it for you and what does it tell the interviewer about you. For me, I want to know if it'll be a good fit for me and if their work style is similar to mine. I like to ask questions like

1. If you had a candidate who was very skilled but seemed like he wouldnâ€™t get along with the team as well, vs. someone who was less qualified but did get along with the team. Who would be chosen? 
2. Do you have any reservations about my qualifications?
3. Why is this job available? Is this a new position? If not, what did the previous employee go on to do?
4. What's the most important thing I should accomplish in the first ninety days?
5. Do you have a policy for helping new members of the team get on board?
6. Do you have any type of continuing ed programs?

I also like to go on Linked in and check out the interviewers profile. See how long they've been with the comapny, who they're firedns are, what they've posted. It gives me an idea of who they are and what kinds of answers I'll get. If they've only been there less than a year, they probably still like the comapny. And I would wonder why they were picked to interview me.

### Take Aways:
1. Go over the Job Description in detail
2. Ask good questions
  - Know what you want in a company
2. Research the company and who you'll be interviewing with
