# BigO

So this is a harder concept to me. I get the basics, but then things get fuzzy.

My Defintion and Understanding:
Right now I understand it as "How time scales with respect to some input". So in other words how much time and scale your code takes up and uses when it runs a program. The bigger the numbers the longer it takes to trnasfer the information.

I found this video very interesting. Because I thought the computer would win over the pidgeon! Haaa, I still learn so much in this industry! 
1. Different Steps get added
2. Drops Constants
3. Different inputs => different varibales
4. Drop non dominate terms

Dropping Constants:
Now I'm not 100% on this concept. But there's this idea that you drop constants in BigO. If the term is non dominatnt you can drop it. I guess becauseit has little to no affect on the outcome

I also find it interesting that nested loops can take longer then 2 unested loops. I never thought that adding would be eaiser for a computer than multipling. I guess it goes to show that things don't need to be complex. 

2 Arrays:
When yu have 2 arrays, nesting the arrays makes it slower than doing one loop followed by the second loop.


Thoughts:
I found it interesting that you can represent the same data in different ways. Like in the video when she talks about mowing a square area. It can be O(a) or O(s2(squared))
