As I interview at companies I will more then often mess up. Do something dumb, totayll forget how to do something, misundestanding the questnion. You know, the usual. 

So as the interviewis going on I will often write down what I messed up on and study the garabage out of it so I never get that question qrong again.

 I had an interview today and I realized a lot of the things I had messed up on in other interviews I nailed in this interview. It showed me how we can take our mistakes and turn them into strenghts. How failures aren' premantent and how its ok no not get it on the first try
 
 
### Take Away
1. Work hard
2. If you mess up practice it till you get it right
3. Don't give up
